            My goal for the "Today" tab is to have it:
            <ul>
                <li> Take in a snippet of the user's notes from class</li>
                <li> Have them explain their note in the text dialogue</li>
                <li> Generate a neat markdown with the snippet and the explanation</li>
                <li> This is the user's concept/encyclopedia page</li>
            </ul>
