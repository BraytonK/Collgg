      My goal for the "before tab" is to have it:
      <ul>
          <li> Take in the user's collage of Collgg generated snippet documents (In the form of a folder)</li>
          <li> Query the user's snippets and generate a 'results' page including documents that match the keys provided. This will be the users' own little internet system :)</li>
      </ul>
